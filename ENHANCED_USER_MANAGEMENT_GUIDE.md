## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Dropdown Not Working
- **Cause**: JavaScript not loaded or disabled
- **Solution**: Refresh page, check browser console for errors

#### Search Not Filtering
- **Cause**: No users available or search term too specific
- **Solution**: Try broader search terms, check if managers/supervisors exist

#### Changes Not Applied
- **Cause**: Database connection issues or permission problems
- **Solution**: Check network connection, verify admin permissions

#### Modal Not Opening
- **Cause**: No users selected or JavaScript error
- **Solution**: Select at least one user, check browser console

### Error Messages

#### "Please select at least one user to manage"
- Select one or more users using checkboxes before clicking "Manage Selected"

#### "Only administrators can perform user management actions"
- Current user doesn't have admin permissions
- Contact system administrator for access

## Dual-Table Display for Admin Users

### How Admin Secondary Roles Work
When you grant admin access to a user using the "üëë Grant Admin Access" option:

1. **Primary Role Maintained**: The user keeps their original role (supervisor, manager, or user)
2. **Admin Access Added**: A `secondary_role` of "admin" is added to their profile
3. **Dual Table Display**: They appear in BOTH tables:
   - Their **primary role table** (Supervisors, Managers, or Users)
   - The **Admin table** (showing their admin access)

### Visual Example
```
Before: John Smith is a Manager
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Appears in: Manager table only
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Roles: Primary=manager, Secondary=none

After: John Smith gets admin access
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Appears in: Manager table AND Admin table
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Roles: Primary=manager, Secondary=admin
```

### Benefits of This Design
- **Clear Hierarchy**: See where users fit in the organizational structure
- **Admin Oversight**: Quickly identify who has administrative privileges
- **Role Clarity**: Distinguish between primary job function and admin access
- **Audit Trail**: Easy to track who has what level of access

### Managing Dual-Role Users
- **Selecting in Either Table**: You can select and manage the user from either table
- **Changes Apply Globally**: Modifications affect the user regardless of which table you use
- **Consistent Display**: Role badges show both primary and secondary roles in all tables
