# Avatar Storage Implementation

## Database Update Required

Before the avatar functionality will work, you need to add the `avatar_url` column to your Supabase settings table:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Run the SQL script in `add_avatar_url_column.sql`

## How It Works

- **Upload**: When users select an avatar image, it's uploaded to Supabase Storage with a unique filename
- **Storage**: The public URL is saved to the `avatar_url` column in the settings table
- **Display**: Saved avatars are automatically loaded and displayed when users visit the page
- **Persistence**: Avatars remain saved across login sessions
- **Cleanup**: When avatars are removed, both the file and database record are cleaned up

## File Structure

- Images are stored in the `assets` bucket in Supabase Storage
- Filenames use the format: `avatar_{user_id}_{timestamp}.{extension}`
- Public URLs are used for display (no authentication required for viewing)

## Error Handling

- Upload failures show error messages to users
- Authentication errors redirect to login
- Storage errors are logged and reported
- Network issues are handled gracefully
