## Problem
- Supervisor account getting "Invalid login credentials" error
- Password resets not working
- Can't delete account due to foreign key constraints

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard Reset (Recommended)
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication > Users
3. Find the supervisor user
4. Click the three dots menu next to their name
5. Select "Send password reset email"
6. Check the email and follow the reset link
7. Set a new password

### Option 2: SQL Command to Reset Password
If email reset isn't working, you can force reset via SQL:

```sql
-- First, find the supervisor's user ID
SELECT id, email, email_confirmed_at 
FROM auth.users 
WHERE email = 'supervisor@example.com';

-- If email_confirmed_at is NULL, confirm the email first
UPDATE auth.users 
SET email_confirmed_at = NOW() 
WHERE email = 'supervisor@example.com';

-- Then you can send a password reset
-- (This should be done through the Supabase dashboard for security)
```

### Option 3: Create New Supervisor and Transfer Relationships
If the above doesn't work, we can:
1. Create a new supervisor account
2. Update all foreign key references to point to the new supervisor
3. Delete the old supervisor account

### Option 4: Manual Password Hash Update (Advanced)
Only if other options fail - this involves directly updating the password hash in the database.

## Foreign Key Relationships to Check
The supervisor account is likely referenced in:
- `profiles.manager_id` (managers assigned to this supervisor)
- `profiles.supervisor_id` (users with this supervisor)
- Any other custom relationships

## Specific Fix for john+4@tpnlife.com

Based on your query results, the account exists and email is confirmed. Here's the targeted fix:

```sql
-- 1. Check the current auth status for john+4@tpnlife.com
SELECT 
    id,
    email,
    email_confirmed_at,
    phone_confirmed_at,
    confirmed_at,
    created_at,
    last_sign_in_at,
    raw_user_meta_data
FROM auth.users 
WHERE email = 'john+4@tpnlife.com';

-- 2. Force confirm the account (confirmed_at will auto-update)
UPDATE auth.users 
SET 
    email_confirmed_at = NOW()
WHERE email = 'john+4@tpnlife.com';

-- 3. Check if there are any auth identity issues
SELECT 
    id,
    user_id,
    provider,
    provider_id,
    identity_data,
    created_at,
    updated_at
FROM auth.identities 
WHERE user_id = '29d0eb05-fb7f-425d-b734-25ab8d7d1d11';

-- 4. If identity is missing, create it (this often fixes login issues)
INSERT INTO auth.identities (
    id,
    user_id,
    provider,
    provider_id,
    identity_data,
    created_at,
    updated_at
)
SELECT 
    gen_random_uuid(),
    '29d0eb05-fb7f-425d-b734-25ab8d7d1d11',
    'email',
    'john+4@tpnlife.com',
    jsonb_build_object('email', 'john+4@tpnlife.com', 'email_verified', true, 'sub', '29d0eb05-fb7f-425d-b734-25ab8d7d1d11'),
    NOW(),
    NOW()
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM auth.identities 
    WHERE user_id = '29d0eb05-fb7f-425d-b734-25ab8d7d1d11' 
    AND provider = 'email'
);
```

## Quick Fix Steps:
1. Run query #1 to check the current status
2. Run query #2 to ensure the account is fully confirmed
3. Run query #3 to check for identity issues
4. If query #3 returns no rows, run query #4 to create the missing identity

After running these, try logging in again. If it still doesn't work, you can manually reset the password through the Supabase dashboard.

## Update: Database Structure is Correct

The diagnostic queries show everything is correct in the database:
- ✅ User account exists and is confirmed
- ✅ Auth identity exists with email provider
- ✅ Email is verified
- ✅ Recent login activity (June 29th)

**The issue is password-related, not database structure.**

## Recommended Solutions (in order):

### 1. Supabase Dashboard Reset (Best Option)
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Authentication → Users
3. Find `john+4@tpnlife.com`
4. Click "..." → **"Reset Password"**
5. Check email for reset link

### 2. Try Magic Link Login
Instead of password, try using Magic Link:
- In your login form, look for "Send Magic Link" option
- Enter `john+4@tpnlife.com`
- Check email for login link

### 3. Browser/Cache Issues
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try incognito/private browsing mode
- Try a different browser

### 4. Check Your Login Form
Make sure you're using exactly: `john+4@tpnlife.com`
- No extra spaces
- Correct + symbol
- Lowercase

### 5. Last Resort: Create New Supervisor
If none of the above work, we can create a new supervisor account and transfer the relationships.

**Try the Supabase dashboard password reset first - that's the most reliable method.**

## Next Steps
Try Option 1 first. If that doesn't work, let me know and we'll proceed with the other options.

## Success: Magic Link Worked!

✅ **Magic Link login successful** - This confirms the account is fully functional.
❌ **Password still not working** - Need to set a new password.

## Fix the Password Now:

### Option 1: Change Password While Logged In
Since you're now logged in via Magic Link:
1. Look for "Settings" or "Profile" in your app
2. Find "Change Password" or "Security" section
3. Set a new password
4. Log out and test the new password

### Option 2: Supabase Dashboard Reset
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
2. Find `john+4@tpnlife.com`
3. Click "..." → **"Reset Password"**
4. Check email and set new password via the reset link

### Option 3: Use Magic Link Going Forward
If password keeps failing, you can continue using Magic Link:
- It's actually more secure than passwords
- No need to remember complex passwords
- Works every time

## Why This Happened:
- Account structure was perfect (that's why Magic Link worked)
- Password hash was corrupted or incompatible
- Common issue when accounts are created programmatically

**Recommendation**: Use Option 1 (change password while logged in) as it's the most reliable fix.
