## 🌐 **GoHighLevel Integration**

### **RVM-Only Webhook:**
```json
{
  "contact": {
    "phone": "{{contact.phone}}",
    "firstName": "{{contact.first_name}}"
  },
  "message": "Hi {{contact.first_name}}, this is a voice message from our system. Your appointment is confirmed!",
  "type": "rvm_only"
}
```

### **Multi-Channel Webhook (SMS + RVM):**
```json
{
  "contact": {
    "phone": "{{contact.phone}}",
    "firstName": "{{contact.first_name}}"
  },
  "sms_message": "Check your voicemail for details! {{appointment_link}}",
  "rvm_message": "Hi {{contact.first_name}}, your appointment is confirmed. Check your text messages for more details.",
  "delay_between": 10,
  "type": "multi_channel"
}
```

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

### **1. Message Content:**
```
✅ GOOD: "Hi John, this is Sarah from ABC Dental. Your cleaning appointment is confirmed for tomorrow at 2 PM. Please call us if you need to reschedule."

❌ AVOID: "HUGE SALE! CALL NOW! LIMITED TIME!"
```

### **2. Timing:**
- **Best times**: 10 AM - 6 PM local time
- **Avoid**: Early morning, late evening
- **Weekend**: Saturday OK, Sunday avoid

### **3. Compliance:**
- Include business name
- Provide contact information
- Respect opt-out requests
- Keep messages under 60 seconds

### **4. Message Length:**
- **Optimal**: 15-30 seconds (35-75 words)
- **Maximum**: 60 seconds (150 words)
- **Tip**: Shorter messages have higher listen rates

## 📊 **Campaign Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: RVM First, SMS Follow-up**
```
1. Send RVM: "Hi John, important message about your account"
2. Wait 2 hours
3. Send SMS: "Check your voicemail for important details: [link]"
```

### **Strategy 2: SMS First, RVM Reinforcement**
```
1. Send SMS: "Important update about your appointment [link]"
2. Wait 30 minutes
3. Send RVM: "Hi John, just wanted to make sure you saw our text message..."
```

### **Strategy 3: Simultaneous Multi-Channel**
```
1. Send both SMS + RVM at same time
2. SMS provides action items/links
3. RVM provides personal touch
```

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

**1. "RVM service not configured"**
- Check SLYBROADCAST_EMAIL and SLYBROADCAST_PASSWORD in .env
- Verify credentials are correct

**2. "Authentication failed"**
- Double-check email/password
- Ensure Slybroadcast account is active

**3. "Invalid phone number"**
- Use international format: +1234567890
- Remove spaces, dashes, parentheses

**4. "Delivery failed"**
- Check if number is mobile (RVM only works on mobile)
- Verify recipient hasn't opted out

### **Testing Checklist:**
```bash
# 1. Test RVM service
python slybroadcast_rvm.py

# 2. Test API endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# 3. Test single RVM
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/rvm/send -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"phone":"+1234567890","message":"Test message"}'

# 4. Check logs
# Look for ✅ or ❌ indicators in console output
