# ðŸ”„ Simple Account Switcher Integration Guide

## What It Does
The Simple Account Switcher provides a clean, intuitive way for superior accounts (admins/managers) to instantly switch to any user account they have permission to access.

## How It Works

### 1. **Admin Login**
- Admins/managers log in with their credentials
- System validates their role and permissions

### 2. **Account Selection**
- Shows a visual list of all accounts they can access
- **Super Admins**: See all users
- **Admins**: See all users 
- **Managers**: See only users in their organization

### 3. **Instant Switching**
- Click any account to instantly become that user
- No complex authentication or token management
- Preserves admin context for switching back

### 4. **Dashboard Access**
- "Go to Dashboard" button takes you to the user's dashboard
- All navigation and features work as that user
- Red impersonation banner shows you're switched

## Integration with Existing System

### âœ… **Works With Your Current Setup**
- Uses the same Supabase instance and credentials
- Integrates with existing impersonation banner system
- Compatible with your current navigation and user management

### âœ… **Role-Based Security**
```javascript
// Permission hierarchy built-in:
'super_admin' -> can access anyone
'admin' -> can access anyone  
'manager' -> can access users in same organization
'user' -> cannot switch accounts
```

### âœ… **Seamless Experience**
- Switch between accounts instantly
- Dashboard shows current user context
- Navigation reflects switched user
- Can return to admin view anytime

## Usage Instructions

### For Admins:
1. Go to `simple_account_switcher.html`
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Select user to switch to from the visual list
4. Click "Go to Dashboard" to work as that user
5. Use existing impersonation controls to exit when done

### For Managers:
1. Same process as admins
2. Only see users in your organization
3. Cannot access other managers or admins

## Files Modified/Created
- âœ… `simple_account_switcher.html` - Main switching interface
- âœ… `advanced_login.html` - Enhanced login with search (alternative)
- âœ… `hierarchical_rls_policies.sql` - Database security policies (optional)
- âœ… `impersonation_api.py` - API-based solution (optional)

## Next Steps
1. **Test the switcher** with admin credentials
2. **Add link** to main navigation or admin panel
3. **Train users** on the new switching process
4. **Monitor usage** through existing impersonation logging

## Advantages Over Previous System

- âœ… **Visual**: See all available accounts at once
- âœ… **Reliable**: No token/session conflicts
- âœ… **Intuitive**: Clear UI for account selection
- âœ… **Secure**: Role-based permission checking
